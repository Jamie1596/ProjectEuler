#ProjectEuler
A collection of my solutions to the mathematical problems found on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net/problems). All of my solutions use the C language exclusively. 

Please do not make use of a file relating to a problem that you have not solved on your own yet. Where is the fun in that?
